## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Arom Sylon Apostle Foronda F. Alcausin

I'm currently a computer science student in Mariano Marcos State University and I am very much inexperienced.

I like all things videogames, so I hope I'll get the knowledge on how to make them someday. I also like watching things like anime, movies and reading manga.
